## SmartTrade (under development)

This project was built to make vehicle trades trustless. In short, the work flow of the trade goes as follow:
1. Buyer funds contract with the agreed upon price
2. Seller transfers ownership of vehicle to buyer
3. Contract picks up the transfer of ownership and releases its funds to the buyer.

If the transfer of ownership is not assigned to the buyer within 24 hours. Funds will be sent back to the buyer.
